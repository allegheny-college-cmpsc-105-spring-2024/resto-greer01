This past weekend, I made a trip to the Energy Drink Emporium. I am writing this review as I am most impressed with the quality and service of this place. It's located in such a great location, making it easy to travel to as it is not very far from my home. When I arrived at the establishment I was introduced to the very colorful menu, everything was clearly posted and was very easy to read, and decide what I was going to get to drink. The cheap prices made it easy to get what I wanted to drink at an affordable price. The $1 energy drinks were so good, I will make sure to return to indulge in thise again, I might even try to become a regular here. I love my energy drinks, and it is important that I buy them at least 3 times a week. Having the drink emporium this close to my house, makes it so easy to get my fix of energy drinks.
