When I look at my analytics data, I can see that one of the plots is tacking the number of users on the webtsite. 
I can see that I have had 3 user in the last 48 hours. Being the head of the restaurant, I can see that my webtsite is starting to do well, and poeple are begginging to reconzise our grand opening. Another thing that I am excited about if the tracking of other things as well such at the map of where my users are viewing from around the world. Google analytics is such a huge advantage to have in the restaurant buisness, as it will tell me about where people are coming from and how they show interest in my place of food. This will give me the edge over my competitors as they might not know how to use this resource to see how their websites are doing compared to mine.
